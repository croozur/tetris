    <h1 class="purple">T-Spin</h1>
    <div class="tspin_info">
        <p>T-Spinning is a spinning technique that can score a lot more points than a Tetris (four-line clear) can.
            This is also used in multiplayer to send garbage, or large chunks of gray blocks to another opponent. 
            When going for a high score, heavy use of T-spins will often net you a new record, although it is fairly tricky to get used to.
        </p>

        <h2>T-Spin Double</h2>
        <img src="gif/t-spin.gif" />

        <ol>
            <li>Form a T-shaped gap. In the GIF, the orange L-block and the green S-block on top with
                the blue J-block and straight piece on the side form a T-shaped hole.
            </li>

            <li>
                Soft drop the T-piece into the hole. Make sure to soft-drop (hold DOWN on the D-Pad)
                as hard dropping will just clear the very bottom line. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Quickly rotate the piece to fit it. In the GIF, the piece is rotated left.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Note that for a T-Spin Single, the T-block above must be rotated right twice instead where the stem of
            the T fits into the green block. It has to be spun and to have left no gaps for it to count as such.
        </p>

        <h2>T-Spin Triple</h2>
        <img src="gif/t-spin-triple.gif" width="50%"/>

        <p>One of the trickiest moves in Tetris is the T-Spin Triple as forming the gap to spin the piece into is usually difficult.
            The T-piece must be inserted under and then rotated either left or right. The sequence of the blocks
            on the right is usually a guaranteed way of scoring several back-to-back T-spin triples.
