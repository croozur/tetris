        <h2>1984</h2>
        <p>Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov develops the very first version of Tetris on an old computer called
            the Electronika 60. The concept stemmed from his memories of playing with pentominoes, or a game where you use
            different shapes to create pictures, and how he found difficulty putting the pieces back in the box.
