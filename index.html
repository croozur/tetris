        &emsp;Tetris is a 2D puzzle video game created in 1984. In its simplest form, players move differently shaped pieces named Tetriminos which fall
        down to the bottom. The main objective is to clear the board of these pieces by filling a horizontal line. 
        Each line cleared scores the player a certain amount of points. If multiple lines are cleared at once (up to four), then more points are 
        scored based on the number of lines. Once a player clears a certain amount of lines, the level and speed at which the pieces descend increases.
        With a higher level, more points are rewarded. If the playing field is stacked to the top with unfilled lines, it is game over.</p>

        &emsp;Tetris is one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, with over 200 million copies sold across platforms. It received a Guinness World Record for "Most Ported
        Video Game" as it is available on over 65 different platforms. Its influence has sparked the Tetris Effect, where experienced players will begin to
        apply the mechanics of Tetris in the real world, such as placing boxes on shelves in a certain way.
