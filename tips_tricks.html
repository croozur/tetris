            There are infinitely many ways a Tetris game can play out. 
            Here are some cemented techniques on getting that high score up.

        <h2>The Playing Field</h2>
        <p>
            The most important part of Tetris is organizing your blocks to make way for the next pieces in the queue.
            Glancing at the NEXT queue often is something that is overlooked, as many players become overwhelmed with figuring
            out where the current piece will go.
        </p>

        <p>
            A <b>semi-flat</b> orientation is the sort of playing field to go for. Let's analyze a playing field:
        </p>
        <img src="images/playing-field.png" align="center" width="20%"/>

        <p>
            There's a few things to take in here. First, the player has arranged the blocks in such a way
            that there is a single column left open to score Tetrises in using the straight-line piece.
            This single column is usually called a "well." Since the well is on the right side, this type
            of structure is called a "right well."  
            Next, notice that the top blocks on the left are a bit jagged, yet it becomes smoother as it
            progresses to the right. This is the semi-flatness of the field, and virtually any block, if
            rotated correctly, can fit nicely in any of those spaces. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's look at another.
        </p>

        <img src="images/playing-field-bad1.png" align="center" width="20%" />

        <p>
            Here's an example of a left well playing field that is too jagged. Pieces like the Z and S block can 
            fit nicely in two of the spaces, but where is the box piece going to go? Well, one solution is
            to place it on top of the orange and blue pieces, but it puts the player at risk of going
            past the top of the board. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's analyze one more.
        </p>

        <img src="images/playing-field-bad2.png" align="center" width="20%" />
        <p>
            Above is a very flat, center well playing field. In Tetris games using the <a href="mechanics.html#SRS">SRS</a>
            this type of playing field can also be optimal due to lock delay, as players have the time to neatly tuck pieces under other
            pieces if needed. However, since the NRS has very little lock delay, it makes this technique harder on higher
            levels with faster speeds for games with this system. In the example above, the red piece on top cannot be hard dropped anywhere without 
            forming a gap (but it can form a hole suitable for a <a href="tspin.html">T-Spin</a>).
        </p>

    <h2>Piece Burning</h2>
    <p>
        Not all the time will the playing field be neat. But to keep it as neat as possible, piece burning is a great way
        to ensure your playing field doesn't get too high or the well you've made doesn't get blocked. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at this video.

    <p>
        In this case, the red Z-block was "burned," or used to level out the right side of the tower. Burning 
        is especially useful in games with the NRS, since, as stated before, tucking is a usually difficult move
        to perform with said system.
    </p>

    <h2>Six-Three</h2>
    <img src="images/six-and-three.png" />

    <p>
        This is my and a lot of other experienced players' preferred field. With a six-three, there is 
        a well set in the seventh column from the left, but it may also periodically serve as a T-spin gap.
        Due to the majority of blocks being three wide, holding right until the piece touches the wall
        whenever such a block is given makes this stacking method very quick.
        The right side is usually filled with L, J, and the box blocks, with the box blocks nestling inside
        the gaps the L and J blocks have.
